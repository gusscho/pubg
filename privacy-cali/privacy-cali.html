                You may designate another person or entity (“authorized agent”) to act on your behalf in connection with
                your request for rights that are guaranteed by the CCPA. An authorized agent is a natural person or
                business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that you have
                authorized to act of your behalf to make a request to know or to delete.<br>
                In order to use an authorized agent for your request, we require that you provide signed permission to
                your agent, using the form available at [LINK]. Your authorized agent can submit a request to know or
                delete by sending an email to privacy@pubg.com attaching the signed permission. <br>
                The above requirement does not apply should your agent have power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code
                sections 4000 to 4465. Please note that we may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof
                that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf. Under the CCPA, your agent is responsible
                for
                implementing and maintaining reasonable security procedures and practices to protect your information
                and
                use your personal information only for the purpose of fulfilling your request.
